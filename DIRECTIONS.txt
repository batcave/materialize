How to compile Materialize

Basically, we just want to compile the SASS in Materialize.

This article explains how:

In your virtual machine, install node-sass and nodemon:
$ npm install -D node-sass nodemon

Then, add the build and watch scripts to package.json, if there are already scripts there donâ€™t forget to check your commas per json:
"scripts": {
 "build-css": "node-sass --include-path scss sass/materialize.scss _compiled/materialize.css",
 "watch-css": "nodemon -e scss -x 'npm run build-css'"
},

Ssh into your VM and navigate to the materialize directory. If you need to create the output directory, do so:
$ mkdir _compiled

Now, start the watch:
$ npm run watch-css
